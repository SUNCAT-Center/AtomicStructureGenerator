# Atomic Structure Generator
This module uses Crystal Structure Prototype Database (CSPD) to generate a
list of crystal structures for the system defined by user. These structures
could be used for machine learning, high-throughput calculations, and
structure prediction for materials design. They are also a very good
source of structures for fitting empirical potentials. The function
atomic_structure_generator could return a list of ASE
(https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) Atoms object. You could use any calculator
supported by ASE for further calculations, such as structure optimization.

This program is developed at SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and
Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University. This
work is funded by SUNCAT center Toyota Research Institute.

The methodology of the program is introduced in the article [Chuanxun Su,
et al. "Construction of crystal structure prototype database: methods and
applications." Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 29.16 (2017): 165901].

Feel free to contact the author (information is listed below) whenever you
run into bugs, or you want some features to be added to the program. Please
let the author know if you want to add the module to your project or make
changes to it.
